This material is the product of contributions from the following people:

* Christian Tischer
* Toby Hodges
* Aliaksandr Halavatyi

The material also owes much to [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org):
the site theme is based on
[The Carpentries lesson style](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/)
and the concept-focussed style of the modules is inspired by material taught in
[The Carpentries Instructor Training](https:// carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
