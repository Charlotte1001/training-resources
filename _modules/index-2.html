  - "Appreciate that choosing the correct LUT is a very serious responsibility when preparing images for a talk or publication."</p>
<p>motivation: |
  Images are a collection of a lot (millions) of values, which is information that is hard to process for our human brains. Thus, one typically assigns a color to each distinct value, by means of a lookup table (LUT). There is no fix recipe for how to adjust this mapping from numbers to colors. It is easy to chose a mapping that hides certain information in an image, while emphasising other information. Thus, configuring this mapping properly is a great responsibility that scientists have to take on when presenting their image data. </p>

<p>activity_preface: |
  - Open the image <a href="https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_high_dynamic_range.tif">xy_8bit__nuclei_high_dynamic_range.tif</a>
  - Explore different single color LUTs and LUT settings
  - Visualise the LUT, e.g. as an inset in the image as in above figure.
  - Appreciate that LUT settings do not change the pixel values
  - Appreciate that a single color LUT will not allow you to see all nuclei without clipping
  - Appreciate that certain colors like blue are not so good for seeing different intensities (grey values are probably the best).
  - Explore multi color LUTs for visualisation of such a "high dynamic range" (big difference of intensities) image.</p>

<p>## Calculate the brightness:</p>
<p>Use the formula and explanations given in above section on "single color lookup tables".</p>
<ol>
<li><code>value =  49, min = 10,  max = 50, brightness = ?</code></li>
<li><code>value = 100, min =  0,  max = 65, brightness = ?</code></li>
<li><code>value =  10, min = 20,  max = 65, brightness = ?</code></li>

  2. Pixels with values </strong>___ the <code>min</code> will appear black (using a single color LUT).</p>

<h3 id="lookup-tables">Lookup tables</h3>
<p>Lookup tables do the mapping from a numeric pixel value to a color. This is the main mechanism how we visualise microscopy image data. In case of doubt, it is always a good idea to show the mapping as an inset in the image (or next to the image).</p>
<h3 id="single-color-lookup-tables">Single color lookup tables</h3>
<p>Single color lookup tables are typically configured by chosing one color such as, e.g., grey or green, and choosing a <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> value that determine the brightness of this color depending on the <code>value</code> of the respective pixel in the following way:</p>
<p><code>brightness( value ) = ( value - min ) / ( max - min )</code></p>
<p>In this formula, 1 corresponds to the maximal brightness and 0 corresponds to the minimal brightness that, e.g., your computer monitor can produce.</p>
<p>Depending on the values of <code>value</code>, <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> it can be that the formula yields values that are less than 0 or larger than 1. This is handled by assinging a brightness of 0 even if the formula yields values &lt; 0 and assigning a brightness of 1 even if the forumla yield values larger than <code>1</code>. In such cases one speaks of "clipping", because one looses ("clips") information about the pixel value (see below for an example).</p>
<h4 id="clipping-example">Clipping example</h4>
<p><code>min = 20, max = 100, v1 = 100, v2 = 200</code></p>
<p><code>brightness( v1 ) = ( 100 - 20 ) / ( 100 - 20 ) = 1</code></p>
<p><code>brightness( v2 ) = ( 200 - 20 ) / ( 100 - 20 ) = 2.25</code></p>
<p>Both pixel values will be painted with the same brightness as a brightness larger than <code>1</code> is not possible (see above).</p>
<h3 id="multi-color-lookup-tables">Multi color lookup tables</h3>
<p>As the name suggestes multi color lookup tables map pixel gray values to different colors.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>0 -&gt; black</code>
<code>1 -&gt; green</code>
<code>2 -&gt; blue</code>
<code>3 -&gt; ...</code></p>
<p>Typical use cases for multi color LUTs are images of a high dynamic range (large differences in gray values) and label mask images (where the pixel values encode object IDs).</p>
<p>Sometimes, also multi color LUTs can be configured in terms of a <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> value. The reason is that multi colors LUTs only have a limited amount of colors, e.g. 256 different colors. For instance, if you have an image that contains a pixel with a value of 300 it is not immediately obvious which color it should get; the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> settings allow you to configure how to map your larger value range into a limited amount of colors. </p>
