title:     Automatic threshold for binarization (DRAFT)
layout:    module
prerequisites:
  - "[Binarization](../binarization)"
objectives:
  - "Understand how an image histogram can be used to derive a threshold"
  - "Apply automatic threshold to distinguish foreground and background pixels"
 
motivation: |
  The manual fixing of a threshold value is user dependent and may require adjustments for every images. This is problematic as 
  it reduces the reproducibility of the results and precludes from applying the binarization to many different images.  
  It is therefore important to have a mathematical approach to automatically find a threshold for binarization.
