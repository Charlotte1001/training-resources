title: Microscopy data inspection and presentation 
layout: module
tags: ["draft", "workflow"]
prerequisites:
  - "[Digital image basics](../pixels)"
  - "[Lookup tables](../lut)"
objectives:
  - "Quantitatively inspect and present fluorescent microscopy images."
motivation: |
  For scientific discovery using microscopy it is critical to be able quantitatively inspect and present bioimaging data. This is important at many stages, ranging from looking at the data yourself, presenting the data to lab members and finally creating a figure for a publication.
