title: Convert to OME.Zarr
layout: module
prerequisites:
  - "[Image file formats](../image_file_formats)"
  - "[Big image data file formats (TODO)]"
objectives:
  - "Convert an image file to the OME.Zarr file format
motivation: |
  OME.Zarr is an emerging community standard image file format, supporting many important features, such as multi-resolution pyramids, chunking and cloud compatible object storage.

  ### Fill in the blanks

    - Pixels in a binary image can have maximally ___ different values.
    - If the threshold is larger than the maximal pixel value in the intensity image, all pixels in the binary image have a value of ___.
    
    > ## Solution
    >   - Pixels in a binary image can have maximally **2** different values.
    >   - If the threshold is larger than the maximal pixel value in the intensity image, 
    > all pixels in the binary image have a value of **0**.
    {: .solution}
    
  ### True or False
    - There is only one correct threshold value in order to convert an intensity image into a binary image. 
    - Binary images are always unsigned 8-bit where the foreground is 255.
    
    > ## Solution
    >   - There is only one correct threshold value in order to convert an intensity image into a binary image. **False**
    >   -  Binary images are always unsigned 8-bit where the foreground is 255. **False**

#### Image thresholding
A common algorithm for binarization is thresholding. A threshold value `t` is chosen, either manually or automatically, 
and all pixels with intensities below `t` are set to 0, whereas pixels with intensities `>= t` are set to the value for the foreground. 
Depending on the software the foreground value can be different (e.g. 1 in MATLAB or 255 in ImageJ). At any pixel (x,y):

`p_im(x,y) < t` -> `p_bin(x,y) = 0`

`p_im(x,y) >= t` -> `p_bin(x,y) = 1`

where, p_im and p_bin are the intensity and binary images respectively.

It is also possible to define an interval of threshold values, i.e. a lower and upper threshold value. Pixels with intensity values 
within this interval belong to the foreground and vice versa.
