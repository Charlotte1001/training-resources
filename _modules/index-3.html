motivation: |
  One strategy to detect objects or specific regions in images is to first distinguish so-called background pixels,
  which do not contain objects or interesting regions from foreground pixels, which mark the areas of interest.
  This process is called <strong>two class semantic segmentation</strong> and is often referred to as <strong>image binarization</strong>.
  The foreground regions can then be further processed, e.g. to detect objects or perform intensity measurements.</li>

<p>activity_preface: |
  - Open the image <a href="https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__two_cells.tif">xy_8bit__two_cells.tif</a>
  - Visualise the image and inspect its data type and value content
  - Threshold the image
    - Identify a threshold value that segments both cells
    - Apply that threshold, generating a binary image
    - Visualise the binary image and inspect its data type and value content
   - Threshold again, now choosing a threshold such that only the brighter cell is segmented</p>

<p>### Fill in the blanks</p>
<pre><code>- Pixels in a binary image can have maximally ___ different values.
- If the threshold is larger than the maximal pixel value in the intensity image, all pixels in the binary image have a value of ___.

&gt; ## Solution
&gt;   - Pixels in a binary image can have maximally **2** different values.
&gt;   - If the threshold is larger than the maximal pixel value in the intensity image,
&gt; all pixels in the binary image have a value of **0**.
{: .solution}
</code></pre>
<p>### True or False
    - There is only one correct threshold value in order to convert an intensity image into a binary image.
    - Binary images are always unsigned 8-bit where the foreground is 255.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ## Solution
&gt;   - There is only one correct threshold value in order to convert an intensity image into a binary image. **False**
&gt;   -  Binary images are always unsigned 8-bit where the foreground is 255. **False**

<h4 id="image-thresholding">Image thresholding</h4>
<p>A common algorithm for binarization is thresholding. A threshold value <code>t</code> is chosen, either manually or automatically,
and all pixels with intensities below <code>t</code> are set to 0, whereas pixels with intensities <code>&gt;= t</code> are set to the value for the foreground.
Depending on the software the foreground value can be different (e.g. 1 in MATLAB or 255 in ImageJ). At any pixel <code>(x,y)</code>:</p>
<p><code>p_im(x,y) &lt; t</code> <code>-&gt;</code> <code>p_bin(x,y) = 0</code></p>
<p><code>p_im(x,y) &gt;= t</code> <code>-&gt;</code> <code>p_bin(x,y) = 1</code></p>
<p>where, p_im and p_bin are the intensity and binary images respectively.</p>
<p>It is also possible to define an interval of threshold values, i.e. a lower and upper threshold value. Pixels with intensity values
within this interval belong to the foreground and vice versa.</p>
