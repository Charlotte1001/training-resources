# Image Analysis Training Resources

This project is intended to collect together various resources that can be useful
when planning/delivering training in image analysis.

Current structure:

- `concept_maps/`: intended to contain SVGs/PDFs of concept maps covering core concepts in image analysis
- `before_after/`: intended to contain small "before/after" images to illustrate the effect of various actions being taught e.g. thresholding, smoothing, etc
- `exercises/`: intended to contain directories of markdown files with exercises relating to each mapped concept (subdirectories named according to related concept map)
- `example_images.md`: intended to contain links to images that would make good examples when teaching
