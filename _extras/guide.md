## White-boards

- Try to frequently use white-board, because:
	- It makes teaching more interactive.
	- It slows down teaching, because you have to draw.
- Make sure you have good pens with high contrast.
- Have two white-boards:
	- One for tidy concept maps.
	- One for messy notes.

## Stand

- Try not to sit, because:
	- Teaching will be more dynamic.
	- People can see and hear you better.
- Construct something to have your computer up, such that you can stand in front of it.
