title:     Image binarization
layout:    module
prerequisites:
  - "the concepts of image files, pixels, and intensity"
  - "something else __that__ `requires` _formatting_"
objectives:
  - "describe the relationship between an intensity image and a derived binary image"
  - "use thresholding to distinguish foreground and background pixels"
motivation: >
  A description of *why* you would want to learn this.
  Can be written in
  (GitHub-flavoured) [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  and split
  across
  multiple
  lines.
