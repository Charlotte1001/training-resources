- Auto thresholding on stack
  - Open [xy_8bit__nuclei_autothresh.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_autothresh.tif)
  - **[ Image > Duplicate... ]**
    - `Title = nohist`
    - **[X]** `Duplicate stack`
  - Select window `nohist`
  - **[ Image > Adjust > Auto Threshold ]**
    - `Method = Try all`
    - **[X]** `White objects on black background`
    - **[X]** `Stack`
    - Press `OK`
  - It can be seen that for many methods, background is also segmented. This is due to the fact that in this case auto threshold algorithms is treating each slice differently (segmentation is done based on slice histogram)
  - Select a method e.g. Otsu and repeat the above process using `Method = Otsu`
    - **[X]** `Show threshold values in log window`
    - Press `OK`
  - It can be seen that Ostu's method is calculating threshold for each individual slice
  - Select window [xy_8bit__nuclei_autothresh.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_autothresh.tif)
  - **[ Image > Duplicate... ]**
    - `Title = hist`
    - **[X]** `Duplicate stack`
  - Select window `hist` and repeat the procedure above using
    - **[X]** `Use stack histogram`
    - Press `OK`
  - It can be observed that now one threshold value (i.e. 91) is used for binarization and background is not segmented
