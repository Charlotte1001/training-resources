### Apply automated thresholds in 3D
  - Auto thresholding on image stack
    - Open [xyz_8bit__nuclei_autothresh.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit__nuclei_autothresh.tif)
    - Select any threshold method and observe the differences in segmentation when you use the histogram computed from all images in 3D stack
