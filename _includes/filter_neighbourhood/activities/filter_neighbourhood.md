## Apply a mean filter and explore different structuring elements
  - Mean filter
    - Open [xy_8bit__nuclei_very_noisy.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_very_noisy.tif)
    - Explore the effect of a mean filter with different radius values.
  - Structuring element investigation
    - Sometimes you would like to find out how the SE (the neighborhood) of a filter looks like. One way to do this is to apply a filter to a single white pixel and look at the resulting form.
    - Open [xy_8bit_binary__one_foreground_pixel.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__one_foreground_pixel.tif)
    - Find a filter that can help you visualize your SE
