  - "Skeleton"
- Make this image take the value 1 so that we can use it as a multiplicative mask
 - **[ Process › Math › Divide...]**
 - `255`

    - "Distance map"
- Use the image calculator function **[ Process › Image Calculator...]** to multiply the skeleton image by the distance map:
  - Image1: Skeleton
  - Operation: Multiply
  - Image2: Distance map
  - [X] 'create new window'
  - [ ] '32-bit float result'
- **[ Image › Lookup Tables › Fire]**
- Obtain branch information by analyzing the skeleton: **[Analyze › Skeleton › Analyze Skeleton (2D/3D)]**
  - [ ] 'Prune ends'
  - [X] 'Calculate largest shortest path'
  - [X] 'Show detailed info'
  - [x] 'Display labeled skeletons'.
- In the 'Branch information' table, you can find information on branch length, as well as average intensity. Since the distance map tells you the distance a pixel is away from the boundary, you can estimate the average branch thickness by multiplying this value by 2.
