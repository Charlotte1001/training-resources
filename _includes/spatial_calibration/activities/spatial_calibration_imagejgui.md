## Explore pixel sizes 

* Open image:  [xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_calibrated.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_calibrated.tif)
* Check the pixel sizes (calibration) of this image
* Where to see the calibration?
  * The image index
  * Properties of the image **[Image > Properties]** or **[Shift-Ctrl-P]**
* How to check consistency?
  * Typical size of objects. Orthogonal view **[Image > Stacks > Orthogonal Views]** or **[Ctrl-Shift-H]**
  * Show example of [xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_badZcalibrated.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_badZcalibrated.tif)
* Explore how image calibration affects spatial measurements, e.g.,
  * Measure the distance between two pixels in the image
  * Measure the size of an image region
* Appreciate that image calibration might be necessary, e.g.
  * 3D distance measurements
* Appreciate that image calibration can be confusing, e.g.
  * not consistently used in image filter parameter specification
