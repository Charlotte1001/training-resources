<h4 id='explore3D'><a href="#explore3D">Explore the spatial calibration of a 3D image</a></h4>)
  - Open an image and find the spatial calibration  metadata; understand why this can be important. 
  - Edit the spatial calibration metadata and perform consistency checks. 
  - Show how to measure the Euclidian calibrated distances of pixels in 2D and 3D.
