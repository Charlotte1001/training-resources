  - Open image: [xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_calibrated.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit__mitotic_plate_calibrated.tif)
  - Emphasize where to find spatial calibration image metadata and why it can be important. 
  - Explain how to edit spatial calibration and perform consistency checks. 
  - Show how to measure the Euclidian calibrated distances of pixels in 2D and 3D.
