## Explore pixel sizes 

* Open image: xyz_8bit_calibrated_anisotropic__mri_head.tif
* Check the pixel sizes (calibration) of this image
* Where to see the calibration?
  * The image index
  * Properties of the image **[Image > Properties]** or **[Shift-Ctrl-P]**
* Explore how image calibration affects spatial measurements, e.g.,
  * Measure the distance between two pixels in the image
  * Measure the size of an image region
* Appreciate that image calibration might be neccessary, e.g.
  * 3D distance measurements
* Appreciate that image calibration can be confusing, e.g.
  * not consistently used in image filter parameter specification
