Open the multidimensional image [xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif).
- Are the voxels in this data isotropic or anisotropic?
- Reslice the image from different directions, such that you can view the image stack from the side, from the top, and from the front.

> ## Solution
> - **[File > Open...]** [xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif)
> - Use **[Image > Properties ]** to view the voxel dimensions. In this case the voxels are isotropic (pixel width = pixel height = voxel depth).
> - **[Image > Stacks > Reslice [/]...]** or press **/** opens the Reslice menu.
> - Select 'Top' in the 'Start at:' drop-down menu to reslice the image from the top and view the head from above.
> - Select 'Left' in the 'Start at:' drop-down menu to reslice the image from the left and view the head from the front.
