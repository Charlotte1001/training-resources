### Explore slicing of a 3D image
  - Open the 3D image [xyz_8bit__chromsomes.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit__chromosomes.tif).
    - The data shows chromosomes wrapped around a spherical(!) nucleus; i.e. the data should look similar from all directions.
    - View (slice) the data in XY, YZ, and XZ.
    - Observe that the image is calibrated.
    - Observe that the rendering in XZ and YZ is deformed without taking the calibration into account.
  - Open the 3D multi-channel image [xyzc_8bit_beads_p_open.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzc_8bit_beads_p_open.tif).
    - Explore different options for rendering the channel dimension (e.g. gray-scale, color, composite).
    - View the properties of this image. Are the XYZ dimensions isotropic or anisotropic?
    - Subset the data such that a new image is created that contains only the green channel.
    - Reslice the green channel, such that the bead is shown from the side.
      - Explore different options of dealing with the anisotropy.
