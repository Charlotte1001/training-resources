- Open the multidimensional image [xyzc_8bit_beads_p_open.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzc_8bit_beads_p_open.tif).
- Use the sliders to explore different dimensions in the data.
- Use **[ Image > Color > Channels Tool... ]** or **[Ctrl-Shift-Z]** to toggle different channels.
- Go to **[ Image > Properties... ]** or **[Ctrl-Shift-P]** to open the properties window to view the voxel dimensions. In this image the dimensions are anisotropic.
- Go to **[ Image > Stacks > Orthogonal Views ]** or **[Ctrl-Shift-H]** to see the orthogonal views of the image.
