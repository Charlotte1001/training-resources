### Subset a 3D image
  - Open the 3D multi-channel image [xyzc_8bit_spheres.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzc_8bit_spheres.tif).
    - View the dimensions and properties of this image. Are the XYZ dimensions isotropic or anisotropic?
    - Subset the data such that a new image is created that contains only the green channel and the region containing the green sphere.
    - Create an YZ slice of the green sphere image, and explore different options of dealing with the anisotropy.
