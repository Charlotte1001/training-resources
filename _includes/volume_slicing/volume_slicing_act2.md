#### Apply reslicing to view a 3D object from different angles
- Open the multidimensional image [xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_16bit_t1-head.tif).
- Reslice the image from different directions, such that you can view the image stack from the side, from the top, and from the front.
- How do you think one could see the head from 3/4 view? Tip: there is a function called ‘rotate’ in ImageJ ([Image > Transform > Rotate]).
