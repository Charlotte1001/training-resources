## Explore LUTs
  - Open the image [xy_8bit__nuclei_high_dynamic_range.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_high_dynamic_range.tif)
  - Explore different single color LUTs and LUT settings
  - Visualise the LUT, e.g. as an inset in the image as in above figure.
  - Appreciate that LUT settings do not change the pixel values
  - Appreciate that a single color LUT will not allow you to see all nuclei without clipping
  - Appreciate that certain colors like blue are not so good for seeing different intensities (grey values are probably the best).
  - Explore multi color LUTs for visualisation of such a "high dynamic range" (big difference of intensities) image.
