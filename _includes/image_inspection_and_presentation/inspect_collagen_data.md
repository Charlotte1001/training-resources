<h4 id="inspect_collagen_data"><a href="#inspect_collagen_data">Inspect collagen image data</a></h4>

In this activity we inspect images of tissue culture cells expressing collagen.

The below drop down menu allows you to perfom all steps in one go, which requires prior knowledge as 
mentioned in this module's prerequisites.

If you are a beginner, we recommend first learning the individual steps
  - [Inspect the image pixel values](/training-resources/pixels/index.html#inspect_collagen) 
  - [Adjust the image display](/lut/index.html#configure)
  - [Inspect image metadata and datatype](/datatypes/index.html#metadata_and_datatype)
  - [Inspect microscope settings metadata](/image_file_formats/index.html#open)
    - Of particular interest here is the image: Collagen  - Molecular Devices TIFF with extensive metadata 
    - Find important metadata that affect the measurements, such as exposure time and illumination intensity
  - [Inspect and display spatial calibration](/spatial_calibration/index.html#scale_bar)
