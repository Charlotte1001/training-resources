 - Open the image [xy_8bit__two_cells.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__two_cells.tif)
  - Visualise the image and inspect its data type and value content, for instance using an histogram
  - Threshold the image
    - Identify a threshold value that segments both cells
    - Apply that threshold, generating a binary image
    - Visualise the binary image and inspect its data type and value content
    - Threshold again, now choosing a threshold such that only the brighter cell is segmented
