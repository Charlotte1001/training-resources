  - Data-type: unsigned 8-bit, values: 0 and 1
- Find/apply a threshold
  - Open [xy_8bit__two_cells.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__two_cells.tif)
    - Inspect pixel values to find a threshold separating fore- and background
      - Hover over the image and observe the pixel values in ImageJ status bar
      - Draw line profile and **[Analyze > Plot Profile ]** or **[Ctrl-K]**
      - Inspect histogram using **[Analyze > Histogram]** or **[Ctrl-H]**
      - For interactive display one can do
        - **[Image > Adjust > Threshold...]** and play with bar sliders
            - `**[X]** Dark Background`
    - **[ Image > Adjust > Manual Threshold... ]**
      - `Lower threshold level` which is the value that you observed in the aforementioned step that would separate foreground and background
      - `Upper threshold level` can be set to the maximum bit depth (in this case 8 so we can have a maximum pixel value of 255)
      - Press **OK**, this will produce an overlaid image where you can see the regions above the threshold in red.
        - Note: The image is not binary yet (check the pixel values)!
        - Important:     Alternatively one can do
          - **[Image > Adjust > Threshold...]**
              - `**[X]** Dark Background`
              - `Lower threshold level = t1`
              - `Higher threshold level = t2`
              - Press `Set`
              - Press `Apply`
  - Set binary options: **[Process > Binary > Options ..]** [X] Black background
  - **[Process > Binary > Convert to Mask]**, now the image is binary.
- Open [xy_8bit__two_cells.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__two_cells.tif)
  - Repeat above applying a higher threshold so that only the high intensity level nucleus becomes foreground
