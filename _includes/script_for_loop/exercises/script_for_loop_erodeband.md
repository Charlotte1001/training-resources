The goal is to perform a series of binary-erosions and compute the outline of these objects. 

 1. Create a variables `maxErode` that sets the number of erode operations
 2. Create a `for` loop to perform `maxErode` operations, change the name of the image accordingly
 3. (Advanced) Create a second `for` loop that uses `maxErode` as counter. Vary `maxErode` from 1 to 50
