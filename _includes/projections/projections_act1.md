### Explore max and sum projections
- Open [xyz_16bit__spots.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_16bit__spots.tif)
- This 3-D image contains sparse dot-like fluorescence signals
- Appreciate that viewing data in 3-D is intrinsically challenging
- Understand that due to the fact that the spots are brighter than the background a maximum projection along the z-axis can be useful to obtain a quick overview of all spots in the image
- Discuss under which circumstances the number of dots in the projections equals the total number of spots
- Also perform a sum projection and discuss why this is may be better than a maximum projection in terms of quantifying the total signal contained in the spots
- Understand that the data type of a sum projection typically needs to be adapted
- Project along the x and y axis
- Understand the projections along the x or y axis typically yield an anisotropic images (due to an initial xy/z anisotropy)
- Resample or rescale the x and y projections for correct appearance in physical space
