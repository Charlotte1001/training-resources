  - `Connectivity: 4`
  - `Type of result: 16 bits`
    - 16-bit because many small objects could increase the total number of labels to a total greater than 255 (8-bits)
- **[ Image > Lookup Tables > Glasbey on dark ]** to visualize the objects in a better way
- **[ Plugins > MorpholibJ > Label Images > Remove Border Labels ]** to get rid of the labels at the border
