### Explore image file formats

1. Image inspection
  - Open different image file formats and inspect their pixel data and metadata
  - Appreciate that some image file formats:
  - include more or less metadata
  - consist of multiple files, e.g. splitting metadata and pixel data across two files
  - may contain multiple (5D) images

  - Example image data for inspection
    - TIFF with minimal metadata: [xy_8bit__nuclei_PLK1_control.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__nuclei_PLK1_control.tif)
    - LIF containing two images with extensive metadata: [xy_xyc__two_images.lif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_xyc__two_images.lif)
    - CZI containing several images: [xyz__multiple_images.czi](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz__multiple_images.czi)
    - ICS/IDS
    - Text metadata [xyzct_16bit__mitosis.ics](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.ics)
    - Corresponding binary pixel data [xyzct_16bit__mitosis.ids](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.ids) 
    - XML/HDF5 
    - XML metadata [xyzct_16bit__mitosis.xml](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.xml) 
    - Corresponding HDF5 pixel data [xyzct_16bit__mitosis.h5](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzct_16bit__mitosis.h5)

2. Image saving
    - Open an image
    - Save the image in a different file format
    - Reopen the image and compare the data and metadata to the original file
