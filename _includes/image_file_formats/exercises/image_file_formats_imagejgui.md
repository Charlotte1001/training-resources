- Open [xyz__multiple_images.czi]((https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz__multiple_images.czi)
  - How many images are contained?
  - What are the dimensions of the images?
  - What are the voxel sizes of the images? 

> ## Solution
> - There are two images 
> - [ Image > Show Info ] reveals that both have SizeC = 1, SizeT = 1, SizeX = 251, SizeY = 251, SizeZ = 2
> - [ Image > Properties ] shows that dx = dy = 0.195 micrometer and dz = 0.3 micrometer
