### Explore dimensions in a 4D image

  - Open the 3D multi-channel image [xyzc_8bit_beads_p_open.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyzc_8bit_beads_p_open.tif).
  - Explore different options for rendering the channel dimension (e.g. gray-scale, color, composite, different layers).
  - Check the properties of this image. Are the XYZ dimensions isotropic or anisotropic?
