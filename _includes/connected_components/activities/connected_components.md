## Perform 2D and 3D connected component labeling
  1. 2D connected component labeling:
    - Open image [xy_8bit_binary__nuclei.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__nuclei.tif).
    - Create a label image by means of 4-connected connected components labeling. 
    - Apply a multi-color LUT.
    - Repeat with 8-connected labeling and discuss the difference.
  2. 3D connected component labeling:
    - Open image [xyz_8bit_binary__spots.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xyz_8bit_binary__spots.tif) 
    - Inspect the pixel values of the label image and see what you can learn about the objects that are encoded in this image.
