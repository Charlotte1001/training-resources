- Open Fiji.
- Download [thresholding.ijm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/master/_includes/binarization/activities/binarization_imagejmacro.ijm).
- Drag and drop the script onto Fiji; Fiji's script editor will open.
- Click <kbd>Run</kbd>.
- Try to roughly understand what is happening in each line of the code.
- Mainly using copy and paste: Add the application of a third threshold.
  - For example, for fun, you could put a threshold here that is so low that the two cells merge into one in the resulting binary image.
