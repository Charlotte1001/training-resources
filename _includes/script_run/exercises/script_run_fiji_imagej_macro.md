- Download [thresholding.ijm](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/binarization/activities/binarization_imagejmacro.ijm).
- Drag and drop the script onto Fiji; Fiji's script editor will open.
- Click <kbd>Run</kbd>.
- Try to roughly understand what is happening in each line of the code.
- Mainly using copy and paste, add the application of a third threshold, which should be so high that no cell is segmented.
