- Download the [thresholding.ijm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/master/_includes/binarization/activities/binarization_imagejmacro.ijm) ImageJ macro script.
- Open the script in Fiji.
- Fiji's script editor will open.
  - Click <kbd>Run</kbd>.
- Try to roughly understand what is happening in each line of the code.
- Add the application of a third threshold.
  - Tip: You can do this mainly using copy and paste
  - It does not matter for this exercise, but, for fun, you could put a threshold there that is so low that the two cells merge into one in the resulting binary image.
