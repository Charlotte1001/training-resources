<h4 id="metadata_and_datatype"><a href="#metadata_and_datatype">Explore image metadata and data types</a></h4> 

Explore the metadata and datatypes of images. 

Observe that for some software the datatype of the image after opening it does not match the datatype that is given in the metadata.

The reason for this is that most software only support data types where the bit depth is a multiple of 8. For example, unsigned integer 12-bit data may not be supported.
