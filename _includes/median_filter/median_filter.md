<h4 id="2d"><a href="#2d">Median/Mean filter</a></h4>
Use example images that are relevant to your science and explore in detail what happens when applying a median filter.
On purpose, increase the neighbourhood to an extend where your structures of interest become clearly compromised. Do some of all of these activities.

- Open image [xy_8bit_binary__squares_different_size.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__squares_different_size.tif)
  discuss effect of median filter on removing small objects, preserving edge and changing edges for large radii. 

- Open image [xy_8bit_binary__large_spot.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__large_spot.tif)
  discuss effect of median filter on edge changes. Use a ROI and apply filter only on the ROI. Compare also to mean filter. 

- Open image [xy_8bit__two_noisy_squares_different_size.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__two_noisy_squares_different_size.tif)
  and discuss effect of median and mean filter of different size with respect to noise and preservation of structure. 

- Open image [xy_8bit__PCNA.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit__PCNA.tif)  and discuss effect of filters with respect to preservation of structure. 

- (Optional) Open image [xy_8bit_binary__test_structures.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__test_structures.tif) and discuss
  what happens to the structures. This is a more detail inspection of what does a median filter do.
