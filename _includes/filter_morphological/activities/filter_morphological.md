## Explore various morphological filters

 Perform some or all of the activities below

 * Dilation and erosion of binary
    * Open [xy_8bit_binary__two_spots_different_size.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__two_spots_different_size.tif) 
    * Explore erosion and dilation 
    * Explore how structures grow and shrink depending on the size of the structuring element
 
 * Opening and closing of binary
    * Open [xy_8bit_binary__for_open_and_close.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__for_open_and_close.tif)
    * Perform erosion followed by dilation - opening. Explains it effects in removing thin structures, smoothing borders. If applicable show that opening runs as single command.
    * Perform dilation followed by erosion - closing. Explains it effects on filling small holes, connecting gaps. If applicable show that opening runs as single command.
  
 * Morphological internal gradient of binary
    * Open [xy_8bit_binary__h2b.tif](https://github.com/NEUBIAS/training-resources/raw/master/image_data/xy_8bit_binary__h2b.tif)
    * Perform an erosion
    * Subtract eroded image from binary image and discuss the results (Internal Gradient)
    * If applicable show where the morphological gradient runs as a single command
