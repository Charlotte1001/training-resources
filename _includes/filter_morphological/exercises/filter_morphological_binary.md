We would like to measure the intensity along the nuclear membrane in the first channel of the image
One way is to use the DNA channel (channel 2) to identify the nuclei. Our first segmentation attemp

Use a combination of opening and closing operations to clean up the binary image so that you end with following image. This is an image that can be used for further processing and identification of membrane regions.
