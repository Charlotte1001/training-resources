### String concatenation
- Open a script editor.
- Create a log message
  - Define two variables: `i` with value `11` and `n` with value `100`.
  - Using those two variables create the message: `"Analyzing image 11/100..."`.
- Create a file path
  - Use an in-built function to print the string that separates folders on your operating system
  - Get the temp folder on your system and store it in a variable
  - Create a path to a hypothetical file in the temp folder with the help of the separator string
- Explore the escape string `\`
  - Print `\`, depending on the language that may be a little challenge.
  - Print the string `"\"` (it should actually print the quotation marks!)
  - Create a string with two sentences and a line break.
  - Print tab separated values.
