//defining variables
//Please note that in ImageJ macro language you can concatenate strings directly with numbers.
//As you can see below, the variable num1 is defined as an integer value. It will give the same result if you define num1 variable as "50" as well.
text1 = "Hello ";
text2 = "user number ";
num1 = 50


//concatenating strings
text3 = text1 + text2 + num1;

//printing the results
print(text3);
