# Scientific bioimage data inspection and presentation

## Why take this course

For microscopy based scientific discovery it is critical to be able to quantitatively inspect and present bioimaging data. This is important at many stages, ranging from looking at the data yourself, presenting the data to lab members and finally creating a figure for a publication.

This course will teach this using Fiji.

## Target audience

Scientists that may use microscopy data in their research.

## Prerequisites

* No computational skills are required
* Computer with Fiji installed
* Internet access
* For the afternoon bring own 2D (multi-channel) microscopy raw data

## Dates

## Schedule

09:30 - 12:30 hybrid click-along sessions
14:00 - 16:00 work on your own data

## Trainers

- Christian Tischer (EMBL Heidelberg)
- Arif Khan (EMBL Heidelberg)

## Morning session teaching content

### 9:30 - 12:30 (including break)

1. [Manual shape measurements](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/measure_shapes/index.html)
    - DONE (Tischi): Improve the figure, i.e. add manual ROIs, remove the binary, make the cc image coloured (like in the measure_intensities module)
    - DONE (Tischi): Add manual IJ GUI shape 2D measurements activity, teach that one can save the ROIs!
    - TODO (Arif?): Add manual IJ GUI 3D spots counting (multi-point ROI)
1. [Fluorescence image formation](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/image_formation_confocal/index.html)
    - TODO (Tischi): Module is still a draft
    - TODO (Tischi): Add activity, using this image: xyzc_8bit__zebrafish_HisGFP_LyntdTomato.tif
1. [Manual intensity measurements](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/measure_intensities/index.html)
    - DONE (Tischi): Add ROIs for the nuclei in the figure 
    - DONE (Tischi): Add ImageJ GUI manual ROI 2D intensity measurement activity
    - TODO (Tischi?) Using the image formation example data add ImageJ GUI manual 2D ROI intensity measurement in a 3D tissue culture image, either in a single slice or sum projection, in a widefield and in confocal image
1. [Manual 3D object delineation](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/manual_segmentation/index.html)
    - TODO (Arif?): make this module work
    - ...one could then use the 3D ROI manager in Fiji to measure stuff (3D image suite)

### Timing

Available time: 3 hrs = 180 minutes; 15 minutes break => 165 minutes total
