# Beginners course for python based image analysis using skimage and napari

## Why take this course


Fiji and the ImageJ macro language have served the life sciences for many years very well in terms of bioimage data inspection and analysis. However, there are some downsides to this ecosystem. One issue being that the ImageJ macro language is very specific to ImageJ and will not help you anywhere else. In addition, the ImageJ macro language misses many features of standard programming languages. Another issue is that many new image analysis algorithms, especially deep-learning based, are implemented in python, which is outside the Java based Fiji eco-system.

Taking this course will introduce you to using python for image analysis. This is useful because there is an already large and still growing number of python libraries for image analysis that you will get access to. In addition, learning python is useful in general as it currently is the most popular language for scientific computing. Moreover, since a few years a python based image visualisation tool, namely napari, exists that allows powerful and flexible n-dimensional image data visualisation, including overlay of segmentation and annotation layers.

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of the python programming language.

For example you should know how to

- assign variables
- call functions
- use arrays
- use a Jupyter Notebook to run some code
