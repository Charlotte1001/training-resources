# Scientific bioimage data inspection and presentation

## Why take this course

For microscopy based scientific discovery it is critical to be able to quantitatively inspect bioimaging data, because it is important to judge whether the intended measurements are properly captured by the acquired data. Often times one realises that sample preparation and acquisition parameters could be improved; in fact, microscopy data acquisition and inspection are typically an iterative process that needs to be repeated several times until optimal imaging data is acquired for the scientific question at hand.

## Target audience

Scientists that use microscopy data in their research

## Prerequisites

* No computational skills are required
* Computer with internet access

## Dates

YEAR MONTH DAY 

## Schedule

HH:MM - HH:MM Click-along practical sessions

### Timing

- The below material consist of N modules.
- Typically one module can be taught in 25 - 45 minutes, depending on how many of the module's activities are taught and depending on whether participants would mainly follow along or also execute an activity independently (see the below "teaching tips" for more details on this)
- It is recommended to do at least one break
