# Scientific bioimage data inspection and presentation

## Why take this course

For microscopy based scientific discovery it is critical to be able to quantitatively inspect and present bioimaging data. This is important at many stages, ranging from looking at the data yourself, presenting the data to lab members and finally creating a figure for a publication.

This course will teach this using Fiji.

## Target audience

Scientists that may use microscopy data in their research.

## Prerequisites

* No computational skills are required
* Computer with Fiji installed
* Internet access
* For the afternoon bring own 2D (multi-channel) microscopy raw data
