# Teaching tips

The material in this repository can be used in various ways. Below we provide some tips and options.

## Motivate and contextualise modules by workflow

The material consists of modules that explain basic concepts of bioimage analysis. For students to understand what the concepts are useful for it is good to provide and image analysis workflow as a context. 

For example, one could:

1. Show the figure in the [nuclei shape measurement workflow](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/workflow_segment_2d_nuclei_measure_shape/index.html) and roughly explain the steps and provide some biological context
2. One could conclude that to start implementing such an analysis workflow one would first need to understand how such an image is actually represented in the computer and how to inspect it, and the teach the corresponding modules (image basics and LUTs).
3. Go back to the workflow and conclude that now one is ready to do the first step, which is fore-ground and back-ground segmentation, and then teach this.
4. Again go back to the workflow and ...

Essentially, go back and forth between teaching steps and always showing where we are right now in the workflow.

## Motivate each individual module biologically

Ideally the example images for the activities in the teaching modules should be biologically relevant and motivating. Currently this is not the case for many modules and this should be improved.

## Teach the first activity of a module click-along style

Most modules contain several activities; for GUI based activities it works well if one shows the first activity slow enough such that students click-along. This ensures that one teaches slow enough and also that one does not loose students.

## Group work

It works well to let students do the module assessments or some of the activities on their own in very small groups (of two persons). The teaching instruction is that only one of the two is allowed to touch the computer. This promotes interactivity and discussions.
